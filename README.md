This particular repository is the starting template for the Hungry Elephant tutorial.

[Part 1: Greenfoot Basics](https://youtu.be/zxaa3X0MihI)
Added a world called MyWorld, and added an elephant actor on the canvas. Added another actor apple and made it fall down
until it hit the bottom of the canvas/world. Made the elephant actor move around the canvas, and added a background image for the 
world.

[Part 2: Game Enhancements](https://youtu.be/TwID9i0Ey6o)
Updated the world by making a score label that keeps count of the score. Used arrays and simple timer to add elephant idle animations to the elephant
actor and made the elephant so that he can turn around and actually face the other way. 

[Part 3: Final Touches](https://youtu.be/GT-eFwa4Abc)
Added two more fruit actors to the game (Banana, Grape) as well as a bomb actor. Maded a random fruits method, so that it will spawn a 
random fruit actor either apple, grape or banana. Gave the elephant actor a health bar label that keep count of its health. Updated the score system so that each fruits grant you 5 points. 
Added movement speed to the elephant actor in which the more health he has the faster it will move. Updated the bomb actor, so that whenever the elephant actor touched the bomb actor, 
it will reduce health. Made a timer to reduce the elephant's health after a 800 milliseconds. Enhanced the game by making it more diffcult as time goes on. Added an acheivement that will pop up 
once the player hit 100 points. Created a starting screen (that will pop up once the game started), and a ending screen (display when the gameEnd method is passed). Added eating and bombing 
sound to the game, as well as some musics. Finished the game by adding some more background images that symbolize morning, midday, afternoon, and night, will display once every few seconds. As
well as some more elephant actor walking animations.
